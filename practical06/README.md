# Files:
## matmult.c
This program file helps in finding the matrix multiplication of two matrices.

### Steps:
1. Define matrix A where A[i][j]=i+j.
2. Define matrix B where B[i][j]=i-j.
3. Compute A*B using nested for loops.
4. Print all the matrices.

## folder Step6
In this folder we implement the same matrix multiplication as above.<br>
The main intension is to separate the matmult function from main file.<br>
To keep the code and logic clean<br>
