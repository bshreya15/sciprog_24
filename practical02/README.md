# Files:
## conversion.c
This program file helps in understanding the logic to convert decimal number to binary notation in C.

## sum.c
This program file comapres sums of 1/i where  1<=i<=1000 
sum1 starts from i=1 and goes till i=1000, whereas
sum2 stars from i=1000 and reduces till i =1.

This helps us understand a little precision error in computation in both methods.
