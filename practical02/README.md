# Files:
## conversion.c
This program file helps in understanding the logic to convert decimal number to binary notation in C.

## sum.c
This program file comapres sums of 1/i where  1<=i<=1000 <br>
sum1 starts from i=1 and goes till i=1000, whereas<br>
sum2 stars from i=1000 and reduces till i =1.<br>

This helps us understand a little precision error in computation in both methods.

# Compilation and Execution:
$gcc -o conversion conversion.c -lm <br>
./conversion
$gcc -o sum sum.c <br>
./sum
