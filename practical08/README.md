# Files:
## gcd.c
This program file helps to find Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of a pair of integers passed as argument.

### Steps:
1. Construct a recursive function to do the same, using the formula below the pseudo code.
2. The GCD of two or more non-zero integers, is the largest positive integer that divides the numbers without a remainder. 
3. For example, the GCD of 8 and12 is 4. A convenient way to find the GCD of two integers is to use the euclidian algorithm.

# Compilation and Execution:
$gcc -o gcd gcd.c <br>
./gcd
